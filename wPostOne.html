                <br>
                <p class="postP">As I've been building this website, I seem to have inherited
                    a much larger appetite for creation; a need to satiate a
                    deep hunger for "making stuff".
                    <br> So, natuarally, I turned to photoshop. Photoshop is
                    a peice of software that I've always fancied getting myself
                    accquainted with (to anyone feeling the same way; do it,
                    and do it soon). However, It's something I've never taken
                    the necessary time out for. Until now obviously.
                    <br>I decided a fun, and simple enough, first project would
                    be trying to "cartoonise" a photo of someone. That lucky
                    someone just so happened to be my girlfriend Rachel (I'm
                    sure she'll be super pleased this is getting uploaded).
                    <br>
                    <img src="rachOneCOM.jpg" id="rach1">
                    <br> This first attempt was a little rough as I hadn't yet
                    gotten used to any of the tools really.
                    <br>So I tried again. And this time I'd discovered the pen
                    tool and its ability in the curved line department (...
                    took a while,I know).
                    <br>
                    <img src="rachTwoCOM.png" id="rach2">
                    <br>I feel this one came out a lot smoother and better generally.
                    Overall though I'm pretty pleased with the pair, especially
                    for my first couple of attempts.
                    <br>The next time I wanted to change it up a bit, and I
                    wanted to get something made in a relatively short time.
                    This is what I came up with:
                    <br>
                    <img src="deCOM.png" id="de">
                    <br>I got the inspiration from <a href="http://daneden.me"
                        target="_blank">Daniel Eden</a>. More specifically, his
                    generative art, which is something I intend to delve into
                    at some point. The above peice however, was simply a doodle
                    drawn with the brush tool and then 50 layers of the same
                    shape, each layer 4% smaller than the previous. Not especially
                    fun, but im a fan of the light-speed, tunnel-esque result.</p>
