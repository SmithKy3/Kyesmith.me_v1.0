In the end, i wasn't happy with it. Got carried away with doing as much as possible with css and made it far too "fancy". New site is about to go up in place of this one. Much simpler, more refined design. See jamesmilton.me or daneden.me for the kind of look i think looks good. Maybe i'll keep an updated readme file next time.
