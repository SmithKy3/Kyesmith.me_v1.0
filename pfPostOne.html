                <p class="postP">It seemed rather appropriate that the first piece of work to
                    talk about on here should be the website itself. I started
                    work on this site in the middle of February 2017 and it
                    has quickly become a small addiction. It seems there is
                    always spomething else I could add or change or tweak. As
                    fun as it is though, it can be equally, if not more, challenging
                    at times. This being due to the fact that before this site,
                    I had zero experience writing HTML or CSS. This site is
                    a guinea pig of sorts.
                    <br>The majority of everything I've learnt so far has been
                    from either
                    <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a>,
                    with the rest of the help coming from google or from bugging
                    my good friend, <a href="http://Jamesmilton.me" target="_blank">James</a>.
                    The site is hosted on github pages for free
                    <a href="https://github.com/SmithKy3/Kyesmith.me" target="_blank">(here, for anyone interested in the code)</a>,
                    and the domain name was free, from NameCheap, for a year
                    with github's student developer pack.
                    <br> I've been trying to write all of the code myself as
                    I wanted this website to be "homemade", I don't like the
                    idea of not understanding how a part of my own website works.
                    It's mine, I should be able to fix it. This is something
                    I've almost completely stuck to as well. At the time of
                    writing this, only one feature of the site was not written
                    by myself, and that's a scroll animation using javascript.(which
                    I haven't taken the time to become accustom with... yet).
                    The code for this came from <a href="https://Codepen.io"
                        target="_blank">Codepen</a>. As my programming abilities
                    grow, I intend to make the site 100% original however.</p>
